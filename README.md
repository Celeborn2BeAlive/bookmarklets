# c2ba Bookmarklets

Here is a short description of each bookmarklet.

## ytmusic2yt.js

Youtube music to Youtube.

Can be used when you are watching a music video clip on youtube music and you want to quickly open a new window/tab to youtube with the same video.

You have to allow pop-ups from youtube music for it to work.

## getpocket_reading_time.js

An attempt to compute total reading time of articles in a page of getpocket.com.

Does not really work because articles are dynamically loaded as you scroll.

However I saw extensions in chrome webstore that simulate the scrolling so it might be possible to make it work (Full Page Screen Capture for example, but when I tried it in pocket it stopped before loading all articles :/).

## quick_fill_form.js

A template to fill fields in a form from the page. Need to be adapted to the situation you want to handle.
